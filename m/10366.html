Two weeks into shooting, director [Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299] replaced him with [Martin Sheen][/p?id=1620]. </li><li>[George Lucas][/p?id=George%20Lucas] was originally set to direct &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; from a screenplay by [John Milius][/p?id=John%20Milius]. [Lucas'][/p?id=George%20Lucas] initial plan was to shoot the movie as a faux documentary on location in South Vietnam while the war was still in progress. [Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299], who was to be the executive producer, tried to get the film made as part of a production deal with Warner Bros. The deal fell through, and [Coppola][/p?id=1299] went on to direct [The Godfather][/f?id=14369] (1972). By the time both men were powerful enough to get the film made, Saigon had fallen and [Lucas][/p?id=George%20Lucas] was busy making [Star Wars][/f?id=19851] (1977). [Milius][/p?id=John%20Milius] had no interest in directing the film. [Lucas][/p?id=George%20Lucas] gave Coppola his blessing to direct the film himself. </li><li>While in pre-production, director [Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299] consulted his friend and mentor [Roger Corman][/p?id=Roger%20Corman] for advice about shooting in the Phillipines. [Corman's][/p?id=Roger%20Corman] advice: &quot;Don't go.&quot; </li><li>The boat's name is &quot;Erebus,&quot; seen on the transom. The back of the seat in the forward turret of the PBR (Lance's position) has the words &quot;God's country&quot; written on it. The steel shield protecting the turret on the back of the boat is imprinted with the words &quot;Canned Heat&quot;.</li><li>[Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299] believed that [Marlon Brando][/p?id=1616] was familiar with Joseph Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; and had prepared for the role before the legendary actor arrived on the set. When [Brando][/p?id=1616] did come out, Coppola was horrified to find that [Brando][/p?id=1616] had never read &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, did not know his lines, and had become extremely fat (Kurtz had always been written as a tall but starvingly-thin man). After some panicking, [Coppola][/p?id=1299] decided to film the 5'10&quot; [Brando][/p?id=1616] as if he was a massively built, 6'5&quot; brute (to explain [Brando's][/p?id=1616] size) and steered the camera clear of [Brando's][/p?id=1616] huge belly.</li><li>[Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299] spent days reading Joseph Conrad's source novel &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; out loud to [Marlon Brando][/p?id=1616] on the set. </li><li>Willard tells Kurtz that he is from Ohio, [Martin Sheen][/p?id=1620] is actually from Ohio. </li><li>The scene at the beginning with Captain Willard alone in his hotel room was completely unscripted. [Martin Sheen][/p?id=1620] told the shooting crew to just let the cameras roll. [Sheen][/p?id=1620] was actually drunk in the scene and punched the mirror which was real glass. [Sheen][/p?id=1620] also began sobbing and tried to attack [Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299]. The crew was so disturbed by his actions that they wanted to stop shooting, but [Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299]||Coppola** wanted to keep the cameras going. </li><li>When [Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299] asked [Al Pacino][/p?id=1008] to play Willard, [Pacino][/p?id=1008] turned him down saying, &quot;I know what this is going to be like. You're going to be up there in a helicopter telling me what to do, and I'm gonna be down there in a swamp for five months.&quot; The shoot actually lasted 16 months.</li><li>[Marlon Brando][/p?id=1616] so angered [Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299] that the director turned over the filming of [Brando's][/p?id=1616] scenes to [Jerry Ziesmer][/p?id=Jerry%20Ziesmer], the assistant director. </li><li>[Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299] lost 100 pounds while filming. </li><li>[Martin Sheen][/p?id=1620] had a heart attack during the filming and some shots of Willard's back are of doubles, including [Sheen's][/p?id=1620] brother who was flown out specially. [Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299]||Coppola[ was so worried that backing would be withdrawn by the studio and distributor if news of ][/p?id=%20was%20so%20worried%20that%20backing%20would%20be%20withdrawn%20by%20the%20studio%20and%20distributor%20if%20news%20of%20]Martin Sheen||Sheen's[ heart attack leaked out, that he kept it quiet, even to the extent of explaining ][/p?id=%20heart%20attack%20leaked%20out%2C%20that%20he%20kept%20it%20quiet%2C%20even%20to%20the%20extent%20of%20explaining%20]Martin Sheen||Sheen's** hospitalization as being due to &quot;heat exhaustion&quot; in the official Shoot Schedule.</li><li>Filmed in 1976.</li><li>[Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299] shot nearly 200 hours of footage for this film.</li><li>During some sequences, the sound of the helicopters was created on a synthesizer to blend in with the music. </li><li>Originally scheduled to be shot over six weeks, ended up taking 16 months. </li><li>A typhoon destroyed sets, causing a delay of several months. </li><li>[Marlon Brando][/p?id=1616] was paid $1 million in advance. He threatened to quit and keep the advance. [Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299]||Coppola[ told his agent that he didn't care, and if they couldn't get ][/p?id=%20told%20his%20agent%20that%20he%20didn't%20care%2C%20and%20if%20they%20couldn't%20get%20]Marlon Brando||Brando[, they would try ][/p?id=%2C%20they%20would%20try%20]Jack Nicholson[, ][/p?id=%2C%20]Robert Redford[, and then ][/p?id=%2C%20and%20then%20]Al Pacino[. ][/p?id=.%20]Marlon Brando||Brando[ eventually turned up late, drunk, 40kg overweight, and admitted he hadn't read the script or even &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, the book it was based on. He read ][/p?id=%20eventually%20turned%20up%20late%2C%20drunk%2C%2040kg%20overweight%2C%20and%20admitted%20he%20hadn't%20read%20the%20script%20or%20even%20%22Heart%20of%20Darkness%22%2C%20the%20book%20it%20was%20based%20on.%20He%20read%20]Francis Ford Coppola[Coppola|'s][/p?id=] script, and refused to do it. After days of arguments over single lines of dialogue, an ad-lib style script was agreed upon, and this was shot according to [Brando's][/p?id=1616] stipulations that he appears in shadows.</li><li>There are no opening credits or titles. The title of the movie appears as graffiti late in the film, which reads, &quot;Our motto: Apocalypse Now&quot;. This was done simply so the film could be copyrighted, since it could not be copyrighted as &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; unless the title was seen in the film.</li><li>Randy Thom, one of the film's sound mixers, said that the sound mix took over nine months to complete. </li><li>The character played by [Harrison Ford][/p?id=1358] wears a name badge that reads &quot;[Lucas][/p?id=George%20Lucas]&quot;. [George Lucas][/p?id=George%20Lucas] directed [Ford][/p?id=1358] in American Graffiti (1973) and Star Wars (1977), two films which made [Ford][/p?id=1358] famous. [G.D. Spradlin's][/p?id=G.D.%20Spradlin] character is named &quot;R. [Corman][/p?id=Roger%20Corman]&quot;, after producer [Roger Corman][/p?id=Roger%20Corman]. </li><li>[Martin Sheen's][/p?id=1620] character name combines the names of the two eldest sons of [Harrison Ford][/p?id=1358], Benjamin and Willard. </li><li>[Laurence Fishburne][/p?id=1567] lied about his age (he was 14 at the time) when production began in 1976. </li><li>[John Milius][/p?id=John%20Milius] originally wrote the script in 1969. It was then known as &quot;The Psychedelic Soldier&quot;. </li><li>Was voted &quot;Best Picture of the last 25 years&quot; by the Dutch movie magazine 'Skrien' on December 3rd 2002. </li><li>The first film to use the 70mm Dolby Stereo surround sound system. </li><li>[James Caan][/p?id=1412] was the director's first choice to play Col. [Lucas][/p?id=George%20Lucas]. [Caan][/p?id=1412], however, wanted too much money for what was considered a minor part in the movie. [Harrison Ford][/p?id=1358] was eventually cast in the role. </li><li>The movie's line &quot;I love the smell of napalm in the morning.&quot; was voted as the #12 movie quote by the American Film Institute </li><li>Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos agreed to let his army supply the helicopters and pilots used in the film. The Marcos government was also fighting rebels in the area where filming was taking place, and sometimes withdrew the helicopters and pilots when they were needed in battle, replacing them with pilots who weren't familiar with the filming, which caused some problems.</li><li>It took [Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299] nearly three years to edit the footage. While working on his final edit, it became apparent to him that [Martin Sheen][/p?id=1620] would be needed to tape a number of additional narrative voice-overs. [Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299]||Coppola[ soon discovered that ][/p?id=%20soon%20discovered%20that%20]Martin Sheen||Sheen[ was busy and unable to perform these voice-overs. He then called in ][/p?id=%20was%20busy%20and%20unable%20to%20perform%20these%20voice-overs.%20He%20then%20called%20in%20]Martin Sheen||Sheen's[ brother, Joe Estevez, whose voice sounds nearly identical to ][/p?id=%20brother%2C%20Joe%20Estevez%2C%20whose%20voice%20sounds%20nearly%20identical%20to%20]Martin Sheen||Sheen's[, to perform the new narrative tracks. Estevez was also used as a stand-in/double for ][/p?id=%2C%20to%20perform%20the%20new%20narrative%20tracks.%20Estevez%20was%20also%20used%20as%20a%20stand-in%2Fdouble%20for%20]Martin Sheen||Sheen[ when ][/p?id=%20when%20]Martin Sheen||Sheen** suffered a heart attack during the shoot in 1976. Estevez was not credited for his work as a stand-in or for his voice-over work. </li><li>[Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299] invested several million dollars of his own money in the film after it went severely over budget. </li><li>When [Steve McQueen][/p?id=1904] was being pursued for the role of Willard, the script was called &quot;Apocalypse Three&quot; as it featured three main characters, including a helicopter pilot. [Gene Hackman][/p?id=1317] reportedly was considered for the role of the pilot, as it was [Francis Ford Coppola's][/p?id=1299] idea initially to cast the three roles with stars. </li><li>[Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299], who considered offering the role of Willard to [Al Pacino][/p?id=1008], said that [Pacino][/p?id=1008] would probably have played the role if they could have filmed the movie in his New York City apartment. [Jack Nicholson][/p?id=1402] also was offered the role but turned it down. </li><li>One of [Francis Ford Coppola's][/p?id=1299] top five favorite films of his own. </li><li>[Nick Nolte][/p?id=1693] has said that he has never wanted a role more than that of Captain Willard, and was very disappointed when Coppola picked [Harvey Keitel][/p?id=1364]. When [Keitel][/p?id=1364] was fired, [Nolte][/p?id=1693] thought the role was his, but [Sheen][/p?id=1620] eventually got the part. </li><li>[Jeff Bridges][/p?id=1441] auditioned for the role of [Willard][/f?id=21949]. </li><li>When [Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299] first described the role to [Marlon Brando][/p?id=1616], [Brando][/p?id=1616] remarked that an American colonel wouldn't have a name like Kurtz, he would have an English name like &quot;Leighley.&quot; Having never read &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, [Brando][/p?id=1616] did not appreciate the reference. [Brando][/p?id=1616] eventually read &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, but not until after the film's completion. After reading the book and liking it, [Brando][/p?id=1616] demanded that his name be changed to Kurtz in the film, and [Harrison Ford's][/p?id=1358] lines were dubbed to accommodate him. </li><li>[Marlon Brando][/p?id=1616] improvised the line &quot;You're an errand boy, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.&quot; </li><li>Most of the dialogue was added in post-production, as extraneous noise (such as helicopters) left many scenes with unusable audio.</li></ul></section>
