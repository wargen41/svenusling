Many strangers asked them for directions and instead of telling the truth they went along with it. They claimed it made them feel powerful.</li><li>In their DVD commentary, [Edgar Wright][/p?id=Edgar%20Wright] and [Simon Pegg][/p?id=1884] revealed that they fully expected the intentional misspellings of newspaper headlines to turn up in the IMDb's 'Goofs' section.</li><li>In the scene where [Timothy Dalton][/p?id=1944] raises his glass to the &quot;memory&quot; of Eve and Martin, [Dalton][/p?id=1944] very briefly looks into the camera. Director [Edgar Wright][/p?id=Edgar%20Wright] liked it so much he synchronized the sound of a cash register &quot;ching&quot; at the same time.</li><li>At a Q&amp;A session following a screening of the film in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, [Edgar Wright][/p?id=Edgar%20Wright] revealed that the film featured disguised cameos by two Oscar winners: [Cate Blanchett][/p?id=1137] and [Peter Jackson][/p?id=1744]. [Jackson][/p?id=1744] appears as the Santa Claus who stabs Nick Angel through the hand during the opening montage, and [Blanchett][/p?id=1137] appears masked as Angel's ex-girlfriend who is a Scene of Crime Officer (SOCO), which is the Metropolitan Police's term for an officer who collects and processes forensic evidence at the scene of a crime (roughly analogous to a CSI).</li><li>According to the director, actor [Paddy Considine][/p?id=Paddy%20Considine] sneaked two [Robert De Niro][/p?id=1808] impressions into the movie, the first a facial mug in the incident room during Angel's &quot;Murder rant&quot;, the second during the final stand off in the pub.</li><li>When wearing his Reverend's costume, [Paul Freeman][/p?id=Paul%20Freeman] was approached many times by strangers assuming he was from the cathedral.</li><li>[Jim Broadbent][/p?id=1459] was a big fan of [Pegg][/p?id=1884] and [Wright's][/p?id=Edgar%20Wright] Shaun of the Dead and asked them for a role in their next film. They wrote the part of Inspector Butterman for him.</li><li>Danny's DVD collection is made up of the entire combined collection of director [Edgar Wright][/p?id=Edgar%20Wright], his brother Oscar [Wright][/p?id=Edgar%20Wright] and his friend [Joe Cornish][/p?id=Joe%20Cornish].</li><li>In the script, Frank's wife's name was Iris, but since [Jim Broadbent][/p?id=1459] had recently won an Oscar for playing the husband of a woman named Iris in Iris, he thought viewers might see it as a reference to that, so he asked for her name to be changed, which it was - to Irene.</li><li>The filming of Angel and Skinner's first meeting at the supermarket was filmed over the course of two days. The conversation was filmed entirely from [Timothy Dalton's][/p?id=1944] perspective first. The next day, early in the morning, they were to film the conversation with Angel's perspective and close-ups. [Dalton][/p?id=1944], much to the surprise of the crew, showed up early the next morning, and even though he wasn't going to be on camera for that particular portion of the filming, he sat off-camera in Skinner's chair and played the role so that [Simon Pegg][/p?id=1884] would be able to have him to work with while filming his part as Angel. [Pegg][/p?id=1884] stated it really showed [Dalton's][/p?id=1944] professionalism.</li><li>[Timothy Dalton][/p?id=1944] has said this film, particularly the sequence where Skinner and Angel are shooting at each other during the chase, was the most fun he's ever had on a film. [Jim Broadbent][/p?id=1459] stated it was a thrill for him to be driving &quot;James Bond&quot; around during that sequence. [Simon Pegg][/p?id=1884] also stated the sequence and the fistfight between Angel and Skinner was the same type of thrill for him to shoot, staying it was very much in the front of his mind that he was being shot at, and fighting with &quot;James Bond&quot;.</li><li>[Edgar Wright][/p?id=Edgar%20Wright] said that the role of Simon Skinner was written with [Timothy Dalton][/p?id=1944] in mind, so they were thrilled when he signed on to play the character. [Simon Pegg][/p?id=1884] says that he and [Wright][/p?id=Edgar%20Wright] shared a thumbs-up when [Dalton][/p?id=1944] first played the character in the read-through, as they both knew they'd gotten the perfect person for the part.</li><li>The second in [Simon Pegg's][/p?id=1884] and [Edgar Wright's][/p?id=Edgar%20Wright] unofficial &quot;Blood and Ice Cream&quot; trilogy. The first was [Shaun Of The Dead][/f?id=18286], and the third is called &quot;The World's End&quot;.</li><li>[Nick Frost][/p?id=Nick%20Frost] only agreed to do the film if he could get to name his character. He was also asked to watch over 20 action films to warm up for the role. He only watched one, [Bad Boys II][/f?id=10653].</li><li>[Cate Blanchett][/p?id=1137] was given a cameo because she's a huge fan of [Shaun Of The Dead][/f?id=18286].</li><li>[Simon Pegg][/p?id=1884] and [Edgar Wright][/p?id=Edgar%20Wright] spent 18 months writing the script.</li><li>[Shane Black][/p?id=Shane%20Black], a veteran scriptwriter of action films thought very highly of [Hot Fuzz][/f?id=14683].</li><li>After the huge success of Shaun of the Dead, [Simon Pegg][/p?id=1884] and [Edgar Wright][/p?id=Edgar%20Wright] were given free rein to do whatever they wanted on their next film.</li><li>Several members of the cast have appeared in the rebooted [Doctor Who (2005)][/f?id=12765] series. [Simon Pegg][/p?id=1884], [Bill Nighy][/p?id=1082], [Timothy Dalton][/p?id=1944], [Olivia Colman][/p?id=1706] and [Bill Bailey][/p?id=Bill%20Bailey].</li></ul></section>
