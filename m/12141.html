[Chaplin][/p?id=1145] later learned they were both born within a week of each other, were roughly the same height and weight and both struggled in poverty until they reached great success in their respective fields. When [Chaplin][/p?id=1145] learned of [Hitler's][/p?id=Adolf%20Hitler] policies of racial oppression and nationalist aggression, he used their similarities as an inspiration to attack [Hitler][/p?id=Adolf%20Hitler] on film.</li><li>[Charles Chaplin][/p?id=1145] said that had he known the true extent of Nazi atrocities, he &quot;could not have made fun of their homicidal insanity&quot;.</li><li>Some reports refute [Charles Chaplin's][/p?id=1145] claims of ignorance as to the true extent of Nazi atrocities, stating that [Chaplin][/p?id=1145] was very much aware of the various goings-on, but decided to make the film anyway as an attack on Nazi ideology.</li><li>When this film was released, [Adolf Hitler][/p?id=Adolf%20Hitler] banned it in Germany and in all countries occupied by the Nazis. Curiosity eventually got the best of him and he had a print brought in through Portugal. He screened it not once but twice. Unfortunately, history did not record his reaction to the film. When told of this, [Charles Chaplin][/p?id=1145] said, &quot;I'd give anything to know what he thought of it.&quot;</li><li>Although this movie was banned in all occupied countries by the Nazis, it was screened once to a German audience. In the occupied Balkans, members of a resistance group switched the reels in a military cinema and replaced a comedic opera with a copy of this film, which they had smuggled in from Greece. So a group of German soldiers enjoyed a screening of this film until they realized what it was. Some left the cinema and some were reported to have fired shots at the screen.</li><li>This was the last movie in which Charles [Chaplin][/p?id=1145] used the &quot;Tramp&quot; outfit - the bowler hat and the walking cane - but although he appears to be playing The Tramp once again, that character had actually been retired in his previous film, [Modern Times][/f?id=16359] (1936). [Chaplin][/p?id=1145] was said not to consider this movie a &quot;Tramp&quot; film.</li><li>Released 13 years after the end of the silent era, this was [Charles Chaplin's][/p?id=1145] first all-talking, all-sound film.</li><li>According to documentaries on the making of the film, [Charles Chaplin][/p?id=1145] began to feel more uncomfortable lampooning [Adolf Hitler][/p?id=Adolf%20Hitler] the more he heard of [Hitler's][/p?id=Adolf%20Hitler] actions in Europe. Ultimately, the invasion of France inspired [Chaplin][/p?id=1145] to change the ending of his film to include his famous speech.</li><li>[Charles Chaplin][/p?id=1145] said wearing Hynkel's costume made him feel more aggressive, and those close to him remember him being more difficult to work with on days he was shooting as Hynkel.</li><li>Shot for 539 days.</li><li>According to his biographer [David Robinson][/p?id=David%20Robinson], [Chaplin][/p?id=1145] despised script girls and refused to abide by their guidance, resulting in continuity lapses in this movie.</li><li>[Charles Chaplin][/p?id=1145] spent some time attempting to simulate the sound of an airplane motor with various methods, only to be upstaged by one of his sound technicians who simply went to an airport for the appropriate sounds.</li><li>[Chaplin][/p?id=1145] wrote the entire script in script form, except for the fake German, which was improvised. In addition, he also scripted every movement in the globe dance sequence.</li><li>When [Charles Chaplin's][/p?id=1145] young son Sydney Chaplin saw the scene where the artillery shell drops out of the supergun for the first time, he burst out laughing. It ruined the take.</li><li>[Charles Chaplin][/p?id=1145] considered [Adolf Hitler][/p?id=Adolf%20Hitler] to be one of the greatest actors he had ever seen, while [Hitler][/p?id=Adolf%20Hitler] assumed that [Chaplin][/p?id=1145] was a Jew.</li><li>When [Charles Chaplin][/p?id=1145] first announced that he was going to make this film, the British government - whose policy at the time was one of appeasement towards Nazi Germany - announced that they would ban it. By the time of the film's release, though, Britain was at war with Germany and in the midst of the blitz, so the government's attitude towards the film had completely changed toward a film with such obvious value as propaganda.</li><li>[Charles Chaplin][/p?id=1145] blinks fewer than ten times during the entire final speech, which lasts over five minutes.</li><li>At the 1941 Academy Awards, the film got five nominations. It failed to win any Academy Awards, and [Charles Chaplin][/p?id=1145] was hurt by this. He already had spent twenty-seven years in Hollywood. [James Stewart][/p?id=1425], the winner of the Best Actor Award (for which [Chaplin][/p?id=1145] was nominated), was not even planning on going to the ceremony until someone told him to go there hours before it began. Interestingly enough, this was the first year in which the winners remained secret until the moment they won their Awards.</li><li>Financed entirely by [Charles Chaplin][/p?id=1145] himself, and his biggest box-office hit.</li><li>When he had heard that studios were trying to discourage him from making the film, President [Franklin Delano Roosevelt][/p?id=Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt] sent a representative, Harry Hopkins, to [Charles Chaplin][/p?id=1145] to encourage him to make the film.</li><li>[Charles Chaplin][/p?id=1145] originally intended to call the film &quot;The Dictator&quot;, but received notice from Paramount Pictures that they would charge him $25,000 for use of the title-they owned the rights to an unrelated novel by Richard Harding Davis. [Chaplin][/p?id=1145] balked at the conditions and inserted &quot;Great&quot; into the title.</li><li>[Jack Oakie][/p?id=Jack%20Oakie] once said that he &quot;had made hundreds of pictures, but they only remember me as Napaloni in The Great Dictator (1940).&quot;</li><li>This movie was [Charles Chaplin's][/p?id=1145] biggest-ever box-office hit, grossing about $US 5 million at the time.</li></ul></section>
