[Cotten][/p?id=1512] later wrote several letters of apology to [Welles][/p?id=1711], and the two later reconciled. [Welles][/p?id=1711] and [Wise][/p?id=Robert%20Wise], however, remained on acrimonious terms for some 42 years until [Wise][/p?id=Robert%20Wise] was invited to come to the stage by Gilbert Cates when the Directors Guild of America honored [Welles][/p?id=1711] with its Lifetime Achievement Award in 1984. The former rivals ended up shaking hands as the crowd rewarded them with a standing ovation.</li><li>One of former silent star [Dolores Costello's][/p?id=Dolores%20Costello] last roles. She was forced to retire from the film business as her face had become badly scarred by early film make-up which was highly caustic.</li><li>RKO chopped 50 minutes of the film and added a happy ending while [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] was out of the country. The footage was subsequently destroyed; the only record of the removed scenes is the cutting continuity transcript.</li><li>Composer [Bernard Herrmann][/p?id=Bernard%20Herrmann] had his name removed from the credits to protest the way RKO tampered with his work.</li><li>The consensus of opinion according to nearly everyone who saw the original conclusion--which included a tour of the decaying Amberson mansion--was that it was much more powerful than the tacked-on &quot;happy&quot; ending.</li><li>Twenty years later, [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] was still planning an epilogue starring the older [Joseph Cotten][/p?id=1512], [Anne Baxter][/p?id=Anne%20Baxter], [Agnes Moorehead][/p?id=Agnes%20Moorehead] and [Tim Holt][/p?id=Tim%20Holt].</li><li>The set for the Ambersons mansion was one of the most elaborate and expensive sets ever built at the time. RKO would utilize the standing set for other films.</li><li>A print of [Orson Welles'][/p?id=1711] rough cut was allegedly sent to the director on location in [Brazil][/f?id=11299]. It has yet to be found.</li><li>The preview of the movie occurred a short time after [Pearl Harbor][/f?id=17400]. Because of this, most of the audience review cards stated that they didn't want to see a depressing movie, and that it should have more laughs and a happy ending. With [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] out of the country, the production team had to make the cuts and changes without his input.</li><li>[Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] demanded that the inside of the Ambersons' mansion be built as if it was a real house, with continuous rooms of four walls and ceilings. This enabled his camera to roam around the house freely and shoot from any angle.</li><li>[Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] later described the 88-minute version of the film as having &quot;been edited by a lawnmower&quot;.</li><li>After a disastrous preview, it was clear to the execs at RKO that the film was too long, too dense and too somber. [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711], however, had decamped to [Brazil][/f?id=11299], where he was in the midst of working on a film called &quot;It's All True&quot; (which was never completed). [Welles][/p?id=1711] had been shipped out there under the auspices of [Nelson Rockefeller][/p?id=Nelson%20Rockefeller], one of the chief shareholders in RKO, to make a film boosting US-South American wartime relations. With him out of the way, however, the onus of re-cutting and trimming the film fell on editor [Robert Wise][/p?id=Robert%20Wise].</li><li>The film had a budget of $1 million, but lost over $600,000--a huge amount of money for a small studio like RKO.</li><li>For the kitchen scene in which George and Uncle Jack tease Fanny about her infatuation with Eugene Morgan, [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] rehearsed the actors for five days. He did not write a word of the scene. Instead, he discussed each character's background with the actors and then asked them to improvise it as the camera rolled. The four minute plus scene plays out in a single take.</li><li>Ironically, RKO's re-shot ending for the film--a much more uplifting affair than the one that [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] had intended--is much closer to the ending in the novel.</li><li>Attempts to send [Robert Wise][/p?id=Robert%20Wise] to [Brazil][/f?id=11299] so that he could work alongside [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] were prevented due to wartime travel restrictions.</li><li>In the absence of [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711], RKO cut 50 minutes from the original film--which was later destroyed--ostensibly to free up vault space at the studio. However, there was also conjecture that this was done to prevent [Welles][/p?id=1711] from attempting to make any changes to what was left of his film. The RKO-mandated re-editing had been left in the hands of two men: [Robert Wise][/p?id=Robert%20Wise] and studio rep Jack Moss. A phone was put into Moss' office that fed directly to [Welles'][/p?id=1711] hotel room in Rio de Janeiro, [Brazil][/f?id=11299]. According to future director [Cy Endfield][/p?id=Cy%20Endfield], who was working with Moss at the time, Moss would simply not answer the phone when it rang, suspecting it was [Welles][/p?id=1711] with his latest batch of comments and suggestions for the re-edit, Similarly, when Moss received lengthy telegrams from [Welles][/p?id=1711] with more suggestions and thoughts, he would throw them away.</li><li>In the original ending, which [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] considered one of the best scenes in the film, Eugene visits a now withdrawn Fanny in her new home, a boarding house filled with noisy eccentrics. That provided an ironic counterpoint to his good news about George's recovery and his reconciliation with Eugene's daughter, an effect heightened when he leaves the boarding house, and the camera pulls back to reveal that it is the converted Amberson mansion.</li><li>To persuade RKO head [George Schaefer][/p?id=George%20Schaefer] to approve this film as a follow-up to [Citizen Kane][/f?id=11554] (1941), [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] played him the &quot;Mercury Theater of the Air&quot; radio version of &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;. It is claimed that [Schaefer][/p?id=George%20Schaefer] fell asleep during it. Nevertheless, he greenlit the film for $1 million, an unheard-of move for a studio whose policy was not to make films that cost more than $750,000.</li><li>There are two versions of how [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] shot Fanny's breakdown scene in the abandoned mansion. In one, he did numerous takes of the intricate dolly shot until the actress almost had a breakdown during the take he printed. According to [Agnes Moorehead][/p?id=Agnes%20Moorehead], he spent the day suggesting different ways for her to play it, then had her put it all together so he could get the scene in one take. When people asked if she was exhausted, she protested that she found the work exhilarating, later stating that she couldn't sleep for a week afterwards.</li><li>The final scene was shot by [Orson Welles's][/p?id=1711] assistant director, Freddie Fleck. Neither the lighting nor the score (which [Bernard Herrmann][/p?id=Bernard%20Herrmann] did not compose for the scene) matched anything else in the film.</li><li>In his first directing assignment, [Robert Wise][/p?id=Robert%20Wise] shot a few additional scenes to patch up the film's continuity. Post-production head Jack Moss also filmed some additional footage. Gone from [Orson Welles's][/p?id=1711] original were any hints of George's Oedipal relationship with his mother, the scenes depicting the town's transformation from 19th century gentility to modern impersonality, and the family's attempts to save themselves financially. The ball sequence, which [Welles][/p?id=1711] had shot in one long crane shot covering the three floors of the Amberson mansion, was re-edited to remove a long chunk of dialogue, thus destroying the effect [Welles][/p?id=1711] had originally created. Re-shot scenes included George and Isabel discussing Eugene's letter and deciding to go to Europe, George's keeping Eugene from seeing Isabel on her deathbed, and the end of Fanny's breakdown. In the latter, everything after the long dolly shot was re-done by Moss to cut down on Fanny's hysterics as she sits with her back against the water heater.</li><li>The lost footage of [Orson Welles's][/p?id=1711] original cut of the film has earned a sort of &quot;Holy Grail&quot; status among film fans. A number of high-profile Hollywood figures have embarked on searches for the footage in the vaults at Paramount Studios (which absorbed the RKO lot and archives) and around Los Angeles, including [Peter Bogdanovich][/p?id=Peter%20Bogdanovich], [Francis Ford Coppola][/p?id=1299], Henry Jaglom and [William Friedkin][/p?id=William%20Friedkin]. [Friedkin][/p?id=William%20Friedkin], in particular, spent years scouring Paramount, as he was married to longtime studio boss [Sherry Lansing][/p?id=Sherry%20Lansing]. As of 2018, none of their searches of turned up the missing footage.</li><li>There is some debate over how much [Robert Wise][/p?id=Robert%20Wise] and Jack Moss fought to preserve [Orson Welles's][/p?id=1711] vision. [Wise][/p?id=Robert%20Wise] has always said that cutting the film was a painful process dictated by economic necessity and changing times (the nation was going to war, and audiences would have little time or patience for the thoughtful, lengthy film [Welles][/p?id=1711] originally made), but [Welles][/p?id=1711] considered him a traitor and never spoke to him again. Future director [Cy Endfield][/p?id=Cy%20Endfield], who was working for the Mercury Theatre at the time, has said that Moss deliberately ignored [Welles's][/p?id=1711] telegrams and phone calls.</li><li>While [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] would direct &quot;Ambersons&quot; during the day, at the same time each night he would work on [Norman Foster's][/p?id=Norman%20Foster] film [Journey Into Fear][/f?id=Farlig%20Medpassagerare] (1943), in which he played a Turkish policeman.</li><li>[Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] had problems with Stanley Cortez from the beginning of the picture. Cortez had great difficulty meeting [Welles's][/p?id=1711] image of the film. One sequence [Welles][/p?id=1711] wanted, a long point of view shot as George walks through the now empty mansion, took him four days to set up. [Welles][/p?id=1711] was so unhappy that he ended up scrapping the shot. Toward the end of production, he demoted Cortez to shooting second-unit work and had his assistant, Harry Wild, take over.</li><li>In a departure from standard Hollywood practice, [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] rehearsed his actors for five weeks before he started filming.</li></ul></section>
