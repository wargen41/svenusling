The Defense Department had previously helped other war films like [Sands of Iwo Jima][/f?id=16675] (1949) and [The Longest Day][/f?id=11974] (1962). Jack Valenti told the President, &quot;[Wayne's][/p?id=1504] politics are wrong, but insofar as Vietnam is concerned, his views are right. If he made the picture he would be saying the things we want said.&quot; [Wayne][/p?id=1504] got enough help from the Defense Department to make this film, which became one of the most controversial movies of all time.</li><li>[John Wayne's][/p?id=1504] character, Col. Mike Kirby, is based on the real-life Lauri Törni, who later on called himself [Larry Thorne][/p?id=Larry%20Thor]. He was a Finnish army captain who fought in the Second World War during the Winter War (1939-40) and Continuation War (1941-44) against the Soviet Union. He emigrated to the U.S. in the late 1940s and in 1954 joined the U.S. Army. In November 1963 he joined Special Forces unit A-734 in Vietnam and fought in the Mekong Delta. He disappeared during a mission in 1965 and was reported MIA (Missing In Action). His remains were found in 1999, and formally identified in 2003.</li><li>Possibly due to the film's extremely negative critical reactions, it's been a long-held belief by many people that it was also a box-office flop. Actually, it was one of [John Wayne's][/p?id=1504] biggest box-office successes, attracting millions of moviegoers and ending up being the 13th highest grossing movie of 1968, with reported grosses of 21,707,027 dollars.</li><li>At the beginning of filming [George Takei][/p?id=1330] told [John Wayne][/p?id=1504] he was strongly against the Vietnam War. [Wayne][/p?id=1504] replied that so was half of the cast and crew, and that he had hired [Takei][/p?id=1330] for his acting ability and not for his political views.</li><li>[John Wayne][/p?id=1504] said he believed the extremely negative reviews probably helped the film's box-office performance. He further said that he felt critics were attacking the war itself rather than his film.</li><li>When the movie was released several critics pointed out that Green Berets were not usually 60 years old.</li><li>[George Takei][/p?id=1330] missed nine episodes of [Star Trek][/f?id=19154] (1966) to work on this movie.</li><li>[John Wayne][/p?id=1504] traveled to Vietnam in June 1966 and got the idea to make a film about the Army Special Forces on that trip.</li><li>[Aldo Ray's][/p?id=Aldo%20Ray] alcoholism was a continual problem during filming, to the extent that [John Wayne][/p?id=1504] had to give some of [Ray's][/p?id=Aldo%20Ray] dialogue to other characters.</li><li>Producer Jack L. Warner, a hawk on the Vietnam War, remained publicly proud of the film despite the poor reviews.</li><li>[John Wayne's][/p?id=1504] final war film, although [The Undefeated][/f?id=De%20Obesegrade] (1969) and [Rio Lobo][/f?id=17710] (1970) contained some war scenes.</li><li>[John Wayne][/p?id=1504] wanted his friend Elmer Bernstein to score the film but Bernstein felt compelled to turn the opportunity down, as he didn't feel it sat well with his politics.</li><li>[Luke Askew][/p?id=Luke%20Askew] replaced [Bruce Dern][/p?id=1114].</li><li>[John Wayne][/p?id=1504] later said after this film was released, &quot;The left-wingers are shredding my flesh, but like Liberace, we're bawling all the way to the bank.&quot;</li><li>It has been claimed that [John Wayne][/p?id=1504] turned down [Lee Marvin's][/p?id=1572] role in [The Dirty Dozen][/f?id=12%20F%C3%B6rd%C3%B6mda%20M%C3%A4n] (1967) in order to make this film. However, [The Dirty Dozen][/f?id=12%20F%C3%B6rd%C3%B6mda%20M%C3%A4n] (1967) was filmed early in 1966, whereas this film was made in the second half of 1967. Other sources say [Wayne][/p?id=1504] turned down [The Dirty Dozen][/f?id=12%20F%C3%B6rd%C3%B6mda%20M%C3%A4n] (1967) because he didn't want to be making a movie in the UK when his wife Pilar was due to give birth in February 1966.</li><li>Warner Bros. was concerned about letting [John Wayne][/p?id=1504] direct the movie because of the fact that his previous directorial effort, [The Alamo][/f?id=10114] (1960), had been an expensive flop. Therefore, they only agreed to let him do the film if he agreed to co-direct with a more experienced director, and [Wayne][/p?id=1504] chose [Ray Kellogg][/p?id=Ray%20Kellogg]. The studio agreed, despite [Ray][/p?id=Ray] Kellogg||Kellogg's** only having ever directed a few &quot;B&quot; pictures, because of his impressive track record as a second unit director on a number of major studio releases.</li><li>[John Wayne][/p?id=1504] was determined to have &quot;The Ballad of the Green Berets&quot; over the opening credits, even though others involved in the production of the film felt it was too corny and old-fashioned.</li><li>[Jim Hutton][/p?id=Jim%20Hutton] was against the Vietnam War, although his involvement in this film caused many to mistakenly believe he shared [John Wayne's][/p?id=1504] pro-war views.</li><li>Late in the movie [John Wayne][/p?id=1504] can be seen to wrap his rappelling rope through a carabineer the wrong way. Called a &quot;fatal hookup&quot; in the Army, this would result in an immediate fall once weight was applied.</li><li>While there was much criticism of [John Wayne's][/p?id=1504] age, it should be noted that most of the actors were considered to be too old to play soldiers. The average age of a U.S. soldier in Vietnam was 19.</li><li>Like his film character of George Beckworth, [David Janssen][/p?id=David%20Janssen] was against the Vietnam War and did not believe his character would have changed his mind to support U.S. involvement in it.</li><li>[George Takei][/p?id=1330] has admitted in interviews that while he was grateful to be cast in this film, he nevertheless strongly disagreed with the film's pro-war message and felt the finished movie was very bad.</li><li>[Oliver Stone][/p?id=1705] wrote [Platoon][/f?id=17462] (1986) partially as an attempt to redress what he considered to be some of the more reactionary elements of this movie.</li><li>The film bore little resemblance to the novel on which it was based.</li><li>This is one of many films to which Roger Ebert gave zero stars.</li><li>[John Wayne][/p?id=1504] wished the screenplay to have more development of the characters but Warner Bros. made it clear they wanted more action than talk as [AlamoThe Alamo][/f?id=AlamoThe%20Alamo] (1960) was heavily criticized for too much dialogue.</li><li>[John Wayne][/p?id=1504] and [Aldo Ray][/p?id=Aldo%20Ray] did not get along during filming. [Ray][/p?id=Aldo%20Ray] later spoke disparagingly of [Wayne][/p?id=1504] in interviews.</li><li>[George Takei][/p?id=1330] accepted his role in the film while on hiatus from shooting the first and second seasons of [Star Trek][/f?id=19154] (1966). As [Takei][/p?id=1330] would later note in several interviews, while he was on set, he received several of early scripts for [Star Trek][/f?id=19154] (1966) and was pleased to learn that his character, Mister Sulu, was going to get a more expanded role on the show. Several episodes were going to better feature him on landing missions and even allow his character some romantic plot lines with female co-stars. However, when the shooting of the film ran over schedule, clashing with the start of [Star Trek][/f?id=19154] (1966)'s filming, [Takei][/p?id=1330] had to bow out of the proposed episodes so the producers of the series created the character, Mister Checkov, to replace Sulu until [Takei][/p?id=1330] was available to return.</li></ul></section>
