At the ten-second notice, he spun around in circles until action was called, allowing him to stagger onto the court in an awkward fashion in order to appear drunk. He remembered [James Dean][/p?id=James%20Dean] in [Giant][/f?id=J%C3%A4tten] (1956) asking [George Stevens][/p?id=George%20Stevens] for 30 seconds so he could spin around to better feel the inebriation.</li><li>The scene with Jimmy and Coach Dale talking while Jimmy shot baskets was filmed in one take. [Maris Valainis][/p?id=Maris%20Valainis] said that he &quot;wasn't even listening to him. I was just concentrating on making them, and I made one, and they kept going in.&quot;</li><li>The movie was renamed &quot;Best Shot&quot; in some international markets because most people outside the US wouldn't know what a Hoosier was.</li><li>During a happy montage of Hickory winning a string of games, Dale was shown saying something to Shooter on the bench that made Shooter laugh. It wasn't until years later that [David Anspaugh][/p?id=David%20An] learned what [Dennis Hopper][/p?id=1238] was laughing at: [Gene Hackman][/p?id=1317] had told him, &quot;Hopper, I hope you've invested well, because you and I are never gonna work after this movie. This is a career-ending film for both of us.&quot;</li><li>While delighted with his Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, [Dennis Hopper][/p?id=1238] privately admitted to friends and colleagues that he felt the Academy nominated him for the wrong film. He thought he should have been nominated for his performance in [Blue Velvet][/f?id=11070] (1986).</li><li>[Gene Hackman][/p?id=1317] and [David Anspaugh][/p?id=David%20An] clashed throughout most of the production. &quot;Gene had me on the verge of a nervous breakdown,&quot; [David Anspaugh][/p?id=David%20Anspaugh] told Vulture. &quot;He gave me my first anxiety attack: One morning I woke up and I couldn't walk, the room was spinning. I thought every day on the film was going to be my last because Gene's agent was trying to get me fired.&quot; According to [David Anspaugh][/p?id=David%20Anspaugh], the only thing that saved his job was the dailies. &quot;The producers said, 'Look, David's not getting fired,'&quot; the director recalled. &quot;And we showed a half-hour of dailies to Gene's agent and he saw that what we were making was actually pretty good.&quot;</li><li>[Gene Hackman][/p?id=1317] insisted on viewing the movie before he agreed to go in to re-record some of his audio. &quot;Angelo and I knew that if he didn't like the movie, he wouldn't show up at the studio to re-record his dialogue,&quot; [David Anspaugh][/p?id=David%20An] said. &quot;But he showed up. He walked in to the room, took his glasses off, looked me in the eyes, and said, 'How the f*ck did you do that?'&quot;</li><li>[Harry ][/p?id=Harry%20]James Dean||Dean[ Stanton][/p?id=%20Stanton] turned down the role of Shooter. In 2013 he expressed regret over saying no to the film, and couldn't remember his reasons for declining it.</li><li>The filmmakers had trouble filling Hinkle Fieldhouse with extras for the final game and needed to move people around when shooting different angles. Extras were given 1950s hairstyles, and their clothing was checked for anachronisms.</li><li>In the original script, Shooter leaves rehab to attend the state championship game. [Dennis Hopper][/p?id=1238], who had just gotten sober, thought this plot point was detrimental to the story. Said director [David Anspaugh][/p?id=David%20An], &quot;We sat down over coffee, and [Hopper] said, 'Guys, I wish I had brought this up earlier. I knew there was something that bothered me about this scene. It doesn't work. It can't happen. It would suggest Shooter didn't take his sobriety seriously. [And][/p?id=David%20An] I know from experience that Shooter made a real commitment, and there's no way he would leave that hospital.' [And][/p?id=David%20An] [Angelo][/p?id=David%20An] and I had been living with that scene in our heads for years. [And][/p?id=David%20An] we really argued against [cutting] it. [And][/p?id=David%20An] [Dennis][/f?id=12020] said, 'No, trust me.' [And][/p?id=David%20An] we trusted him, and he was absolutely right.&quot;</li><li>[Jack Nicholson][/p?id=1402] wanted to play Coach Norman Dale, but he was serving as a witness in a lawsuit, which sidelined him for six months. He told the producers he knew they were on a tight schedule to shoot, and if they found another actor, to go ahead. If not, he could do it the next year. [Gene Hackman][/p?id=1317] then signed on for the part. After the film came out, [Nicholson][/p?id=1402] said to [David Anspaugh][/p?id=David%20An] that the movie and its stars were great, but that it would have been a &quot;megahit&quot; if he had been the star.</li><li>[Dennis Hopper][/p?id=1238] was also reluctant to play Shooter, as he had &quot;just stopped drinking&quot;.</li><li>Features [Dennis Hopper][/p?id=1238]'s only Oscar-nominated performance.</li><li>Said director [David Anspaugh][/p?id=David%20Anspaugh], &quot;[Before filming began] I was so excited to have [Gene Hackman][/p?id=1317]. He was the coolest guy to hang out with. He was funny and irreverent and [told] great stories and all that. [And][/p?id=David%20An] then, first day of shooting, I didn't recognize [him]. He became an entirely different person. [And][/p?id=David%20An] he just made it hell on Earth for me every day. ... He was everything negative. He wanted off the movie.&quot;</li><li>Writer/producer Angelo Pizzo described how [Gene Hackman][/p?id=1317] caused problems during filming: &quot;When he arrived, he was in a generally foul mood. We called him the black cloud. He started complaining about everything. There were some blowups on the set, some throwing of jackets and near-fistfights. There was all sorts of drama on the set. Then [Dennis Hopper][/p?id=1238] arrived three weeks into shooting, and he settled Gene down. I think Gene decided to just suck it up and finish it and get out of there.&quot; According to Pizzo, on the last day of filming, [Hackman][/p?id=1317] said, &quot;I just want you to be prepared for the fact that this movie might get on a few screens here in Indiana, but then it will end up in the dustbin of films that never made it, and the only people who will remember it are you two. [And][/p?id=David%20An] I hope I forget it when my plane lands in Los [Angeles][/p?id=David%20An].&quot; Commented Pizzo, &quot;Gene had a lot more experience in filmmaking than we did, so we thought his assessment was probably accurate.&quot;</li><li>A Hoosier is defined as someone who was born in Indiana or lives there.</li></ul></section>
