DeMille][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille] used the engine blast from tied-down Egyptian air force planes.</li><li>[Cecil B. DeMille][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille] suffered a heart attack during the production after climbing 130 feet to check a faulty camera perched on one of the giant gates used during the exodus sequence, as it was occurring. He took two of days off and then, against his doctor's orders, returned to work to complete the film.</li><li>The orgy sequence took 3 weeks to film.</li><li>Every year since 1973, American TV network ABC airs this film on Easter, or Passover. In 1999, when for some reason ABC chose not to televise it, they received numerous irate phone calls from people accustomed to watching it every Easter than they have for any other film they have ever telecast.</li><li>Up until the release of [The Passion Of The Christ][/f?id=17380] (2004) in 2004, De tio budorden  (1956) was the highest grossing religious epic in history, earning over $65.5 million in 1956. (This translates into $446 million, in current figures and inflation, throughout the years.)</li><li>Last film directed and produced by [Cecil B. DeMille][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille], who, despite his fame and success, won only one Oscar, for &quot;[The Greatest Show on Earth][/f?id=21792]&quot; - not for his Biblical spectaculars.</li><li>Just under 5% of the film was actually shot in Egypt.</li><li>Apart from [Charlton Heston][/p?id=1151], almost no one in the leading and major supporting parts were actually Paramount contract players. By 1954, when the film began shooting, most of the studios had dropped their contract players due to sweeping changes in the industry and competition with television.</li><li>This was legendary film composer Elmer Bernstein's first major project. Bernstein had just had some success with his jazz score for [The Man with the Golden Arm][/f?id=16014] (1955). However, he was not [Cecil B. DeMille's][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille] first choice to score the film. [DeMille][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille] had a long relationship with Paramount contract composer Victor Young, who had been working with [DeMille][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille] since [North West Mounted Police][/f?id=Hj%C3%A4lteskvadronen] (1940). Unfortunately, Young had become very ill and could not accept the assignment.</li><li>[Cecil B. DeMille's][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille] original choice for Moses was [William Boyd][/p?id=William%20Boyd], best known as &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot;. [Boyd][/p?id=William%20Boyd] turned down the role, fearing his &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot; popularity, would hurt the movie's fame, deeply.</li><li>[Charlton Heston][/p?id=1151] was chosen for the role of Moses by [Cecil B. DeMille][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille] because he bore a resemblance to Michelangelo's statue of Moses in Rome. [Heston][/p?id=1151] later played Michelangelo in [The Agony and the Ecstasy][/f?id=21524] (1965).</li><li>When [Woody Strode][/p?id=2012] reported to work, he presented [Cecil B. DeMille][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille] with an antique Bible, that [Woody Strode's][/p?id=2012] wife had found. [DeMille][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille] was so impressed with the gift he not only put [Strode][/p?id=2012] in two parts in the film but told [Strode][/p?id=2012] that if he ever wanted a part in a future [DeMille][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille] film, all he had to do was ask. Unfortunately, this project was [DeMille's][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille] final film, due to declining health.</li><li>Urban legend has it that [Anne Baxter's][/p?id=Anne%20Baxter] character's name was changed from Nefertiti to Nefertiri because [Cecil B. DeMille][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille]  was afraid people would make &quot;boob&quot; jokes. In reality, [DeMille][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille] was sticking to history: Rameses II's queen was called Nefretiri. Nefertiti lived about 60 years earlier than Rameses and Nefertiti. Both names mean &quot;Beautiful&quot;.</li><li>Feature film debut of [Robert Vaughn][/p?id=1826].</li><li>Producer/Director [Cecil B. DeMille][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille]  reached 75 years of age during the production of this film, making him the oldest working Hollywood director. He later suffered a heart-attack on the set, returning to the set only two days later. After this was completed, he planned on another epic production. He died in 1959, before he could direct or produce another, making this his final film.</li><li>During the early part of principal photography, [Yul Brynner][/p?id=2014] was still on Broadway starring in [The King and I][/f?id=15576] (1956). All of his shots on the actual Egyptian locations were done in one day after which he had to fly back to New York.</li><li>[Charlton Heston][/p?id=1151] personally requested to [Cecil B. DeMille][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille] to let him be the voice of God, at the scene of the Burning Bush, and [DeMille][/p?id=Cecil%20B.%20DeMille] agreed.</li><li>The pillar of fire, which kept the Egyptians from getting closer to the Israelites just before they crossed the Red Sea, was not achieved through the use of actual flames, but was instead, an animated &quot;cartoon fire&quot;. Of all the special effects in the film, it is the one that looks the least realistic to modern audiences, and probably seemed just as unrealistic in 1956.</li></ul></section>
