On the Halloween: 25 Years of [Terror][/f?id=20110] (2006) DVD, they stated that the studio, producers, and director interfered and argued to the point of ridiculousness which resulted in a very poorly directed and edited film.</li><li>[Paul Rudd's][/p?id=1729] film debut; it was filmed before Clueless (1995), his first big-screen appearance.</li><li>[Danielle Harris][/p?id=Danielle%20Harris] wanted to reclaim her role as Jamie, but turned it down when Dimension Films refused to pay her the $5,000 she wanted.</li><li>The producers of the movie wanted [Brian Andrews][/p?id=Brian%20Andrews] to reprise his role as Tommy Doyle from the original [Halloween][/f?id=10235]. However, [Andrews][/p?id=Brian%20Andrews] did not have an agent, so they could not get in contact with him. He regrets missing the opportunity.</li><li>Daniel Farrands' original script was far more moody and psychological than the final draft. After reading the script, one of the execs at Dimension films could not sleep that night and therefore called Farrands immediately and told him that they wanted go forward with it. [Donald Pleasence][/p?id=1250] himself supported the original script and immediately signed on to make the film only to find out that the script was being rewritten.</li><li>[Peter Jackson][/p?id=1744] was asked to direct.</li><li>As a result of [Donald Pleasence's][/p?id=1250] death, as well as creative differences between [Joe Chappelle][/p?id=Joe%20Chappelle] and the producer, and an allegedly bad test screening of the original work (the famous producer's cut) re-shoots were done as well as lots of editing, to the anger of most of the cast and crew. Many vowed never to make another Halloween movie again after all the changes.</li><li>For years after the theatrical release of this film, the only way to watch the Producer's Cut was by bootleg copies which had poor video and audio quality rendering it nearly unwatchable, the footage managed to survive being destroyed by being released illegally. On September 23rd, 2014, Shout Factory released the original Producer's Cut on Blu Ray, with a restored picture from the original negative which is available in the Halloween Complete Collection for the first time. It was finally given an individual release by Miramax films on September 2015 though without the bonus features from the collection.</li><li>The original title of the movie was &quot;Halloween 666: The Origin of Michael Myers&quot;. There are even existing ad prints and early trailers with that title. Later, it became &quot;Halloween 6&quot; and finally &quot;Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers&quot;.</li><li>In early 1995, after filming and editing was completed, Halloween 6 was given a test screening which, as described by actress [Marianne Hagan][/p?id=Marianne%20Hagan], &quot;consisted primarily of 14-year-old boys.&quot; During the Q&amp;A afterward, one of them expressed great displeasure at the ending of the film, which entailed a Celtic ritual and the passing on of the Curse of Thorn to the Dr. Loomis character. This led to reshoots to craft a new ending, but there was a big problem: [Donald Pleasence][/p?id=1250] could not be present for them on account of having died in February. Not only was a new ending shot anyway, but over twenty minutes of other footage was changed as well, leaving gaping plot holes that rendered the film nearly incomprehensible.</li><li>Daniel Farrands has said his initial intent for Halloween 6 was to &quot;bridge the later films (4-5) in the series to the earlier films (1-2) while at the same time taking the story into new territory so that the series could expand for future instalments.&quot;</li><li>It was Daniel Farrands who suggested that the film be called 'The Curse of Michael Myers' due to the troubled production.</li><li>Although Daniel Farrands thinks both versions of the film are poor, he considers the Producer's Cut to be the superior version.</li><li>During production of Halloween 6, distributor Dimension Films was having budget issues with its other upcoming horror sequel, [Hellraiser][/f?id=14501]: Bloodline (1996), and reportedly slashed $1 million dollars from Halloween 6's budget as a result.</li><li>Many of [Donald Pleasence's][/p?id=1250] scenes were edited out of the film because [Joe Chappelle][/p?id=Joe%20Chappelle] found him &quot;boring&quot;.</li><li>Only film in the series to have a male protagonist.</li><li>Daniel Farrands was a longtime fan of the series. He had compiled a notebook filled with research on the series, including a timeline, bios for every character, a &quot;family tree&quot; of the Myers and Strode families, and research on the runic symbol of Thorn that had appeared in [Halloween 5][/f?id=10239] (1989).</li><li>[Denise Richards][/p?id=Denise%20Richards] was considered and turned down for the role of &quot;Beth.&quot;</li><li>The script went through eleven different drafts.</li><li>[Howard Stern][/p?id=Howard%20Stern] was originally offered the role as radio &quot;shock jock&quot; Barry Simms, but turned it down.</li><li>According to [Marianne Hagan][/p?id=Marianne%20Hagan], she almost did not receive the leading role of Kara Strode - Miramax Films purportedly did not like her physical appearance, deeming her &quot;too thin&quot;, and her chin &quot;too pointy&quot;.</li><li>The film begins with a flashback to the ending of [Halloween 5][/f?id=10239] (1989) to explain that Jamie was kidnapped after the police station massacre by the Man In Black and held by the Thorn Occult. However, at the end of the last film, it is shown that the Man In Black has already fled with [Michael Meyers][/p?id=Michael%20Meyer] and Jamie had arrived at the station after they had left and was not taken by the Man In Black.</li><li>At one time [Scott Spiegel][/p?id=Scott%20Spiegel] was going to direct and his friend [Quentin Tarantino][/p?id=1763] produce.</li><li>Producer [Paul Freeman][/p?id=Paul%20Freeman] and director [Joe Chappelle][/p?id=Joe%20Chappelle] reportedly rewrote the ending on-set, even from shot to shot as production deadlines loomed large. [Freeman][/p?id=Paul%20Freeman] also sent the crew home when crucial scenes needed to be shot; deleting scripted scenes indiscriminately, rewrote dialogue and action sequences; and took it upon himself to direct second-unit shots as well supervise the post-production phase of the original cut and made a series of blunders that resulted in Miramax taking control of the film, ordering reshoots.</li><li>Daniel Farrands wanted [Christopher Lee][/p?id=1169] to play Dr. Terence Wynn in the film but it never happened, the same situation happened when [John Carpenter][/p?id=John%20Carpenter] offered [Lee][/p?id=1169] the Dr. Loomis role in [Halloween][/f?id=10235] (1978).</li><li>Daniel Farrands stated in an interview that [Joe Chappelle][/p?id=Joe%20Chappelle] used little to no ideas from his script. He had completely re-written the entire third act which included a completely (confusing) different ending. Daniel's original script dealt more with the cult and rune of Thorn.</li><li>Cult movie director [Jeff Burr][/p?id=Jeff%20Burr] expressed interest in directing a Halloween 6 at one point.</li><li>Many of the crew have gone on the record to state that director [Joe Chappelle][/p?id=Joe%20Chappelle] told them from the outset that he didn't like the Halloween films, and was only involved in this project because it got him a three-picture deal with Miramax. His next two films after this were both Miramax releases.</li></ul></section>
