He is quoted saying both, &quot;Gone with the Wind (1939) is going to be the biggest flop in Hollywood history,&quot; and, &quot;I'm just glad it'll be [Clark Gable][/p?id=1178] who's falling on his face and not [Gary Cooper][/p?id=1314].&quot;</li><li>First color film to win the Best Picture Oscar.</li><li>There are more than 50 speaking roles and 2,400 extras in the film.</li><li>The only four actors David O. Selznick ever seriously considered for the role Rhett Butler were [Clark Gable][/p?id=1178], [Gary Cooper][/p?id=1314], [Errol Flynn][/p?id=Errol%20Flynn] and [Ronald Colman][/p?id=Ronald%20Colman]. The chief impediment to [Gable's][/p?id=1178] casting was his MGM contract. [Gable][/p?id=1178] was not drawn to the material; he didn't see himself in a period production, and didn't believe that he could live up to the public's anticipation of the character. Eventually, he was persuaded by a $50,000 bonus which would enable him to divorce his second wife Maria (&quot;Ria&quot;) and marry [Carole Lombard][/p?id=Carole%20Lombard].</li><li>One of the reasons that [Clark Gable][/p?id=1178] hesitated to do the film was his participation in a previous costume drama [Parnell][/f?id=Den%20Kvinna%20Han%20%C3%84lskade] (1937) in 1937. The film was a terrible, embarrassing failure and [Gable][/p?id=1178] regretted accepting the role.</li><li>Among the many famous actress considered for the part of Scarlett were [Jean Arthur][/p?id=Jean%20Arthur], [Lucille Ball][/p?id=Lucille%20Ball], [Tallulah Bankhead][/p?id=Tallulah%20Bankhead], [Bette Davis][/p?id=Bette%20Davis], [Claudette Colbert][/p?id=Claudette%20Colbert], [Joan Crawford][/p?id=Joan%20Crawford], [Paulette Goddard][/p?id=Paulette%20Goddard], [Katharine Hepburn][/p?id=1531], [Olivia de Havilland][/p?id=Olivia%20de%20Havilland], [Carole Lombard][/p?id=Carole%20Lombard], Norma Shearer, [Barbara Stanwyck][/p?id=Barbara%20Stanwyck], and [Margaret Sullavan][/p?id=Margaret%20Sullavan]. [Bankhead][/p?id=Tallulah%20Bankhead] (an authentic &quot;Southern Belle&quot; from Alabama) was the clear front-runner, but her unsavory personal life made producers reluctant to hire her.</li><li>One month after the book was published, David O. Selznick purchased the movie rights from Margaret Mitchell for an unprecedented $50,000. At the time it was the highest sum that had ever been paid for an author's first novel. Realizing he had underpaid Mitchell, Selznick gave her an additional $50,000 as a bonus when he dissolved Selznick-International Pictures in 1942.</li><li>The film has never been cut. Recent releases are longer because of the added Overture, intermission, and exit music, not because any deleted scenes have been restored.</li><li>Very few of the principal cast members liked the characters they were portraying. [Clark Gable][/p?id=1178] was induced into accepting his role through arrangements to divorce his current wife and marry [Carole Lombard][/p?id=Carole%20Lombard]. [Rand Brooks][/p?id=Rand%20Brooks], who played Scarlett's first husband, Charles Hamilton, was actually a rough outdoors-man who objected to playing a wimpy character. [Butterfly McQueen][/p?id=Butterfly%20McQueen] disliked the negative stereotype of her character. [Leslie Howard][/p?id=Leslie%20Howard] felt he was too old for the role of Ashley Wilkes and complained that his costumes made him look like &quot;a fairy doorman&quot; at a hotel.</li><li>For the scene in which Scarlett escapes the burning of the Atlanta Depot, a horse was needed to play woebegone, an old nag on the verge of collapse. A suitable candidate was finally found, but weeks later, when the horse was brought to the set, it had gained weight and its ribs were no longer visible. There was no time to find a replacement, so the makeup department painted dark shadows on its ribs to give the appearance of malnourishment.</li><li>In the scene where Scarlett searches for Dr. Meade, making her way among 1,600 suffering and dying Confederate soldiers, to cut costs and still comply with a union rule that dictated the use of a certain percentage of extras in the cast, 800 dummies were scattered among 800 extras.</li><li>In the scene where Rhett pours Mammy a drink after the birth of Bonnie, for a joke during a take, [Clark Gable][/p?id=1178] actually poured alcohol instead of the usual tea into the decanter without [Hattie McDaniel][/p?id=Hattie%20McDaniel] knowing it until she took a swig.</li><li>In the scene after Scarlett returns to a decimated Tara, digs up a radish in the garden, then retches and gives her famous &quot;As God is my witness... &quot; line, the vomiting sounds were actually looped by [Olivia de Havilland][/p?id=Olivia%20de%20Havilland]. One version of the story is that [Vivien Leigh][/p?id=Vivien%20Leigh] &quot;could not&quot; produce a convincing enough retching sound. Another version of the story is that [Vivien Leigh][/p?id=Vivien%20Leigh] &quot;would not&quot; make the retching sound because &quot;it simply was not lady-like&quot;.</li><li>[Vivien Leigh][/p?id=Vivien%20Leigh] worked for 125 days and received about $25,000. [Clark Gable][/p?id=1178] worked for 71 days and received over $120,000.</li><li>David O. Selznick asked [Alfred Hitchcock][/p?id=1021] for help with the scene in which the women wait for the men from the raid on Shantytown and Melanie reads &quot;[David Copperfield][/p?id=David%20Copperfield]&quot;. [Hitchcock][/p?id=1021] delivered a precise treatment, complete with descriptions of shots and camera angles. [Hitchcock][/p?id=1021] wanted to show Rhett, Ashley, etc. outside the house, dodging the Union soldiers. He also wanted an exchange of meaningful glances between Melanie and Rhett inside the house. Virtually nothing of this treatment was used.</li><li>[Clark Gable][/p?id=1178] was so distressed over the requirement that he cry on film (during the scene where Melanie is comforting Rhett after Scarlett's miscarriage) that he almost quit. [Olivia de Havilland][/p?id=Olivia%20de%20Havilland] convinced him to stay.</li><li>[Hattie McDaniel][/p?id=Hattie%20McDaniel] became the first African-American to be nominated for, and win, an Academy Award.</li><li>At nearly four hours long, this is longest running of all movies to win the Best Picture Academy Award.</li><li>During filming [Vivien Leigh][/p?id=Vivien%20Leigh] reportedly smoked four packets of cigarettes a day. [Clark Gable][/p?id=1178] smoked three packs a day throughout his career.</li><li>The fact that [Hattie McDaniel][/p?id=Hattie%20McDaniel] would be unable to attend the premiere in racially segregated Atlanta annoyed [Clark Gable][/p?id=1178] so much that he threatened to boycott the premiere unless she could attend. He later relented when she convinced him to go.</li><li>Margaret Mitchell personally approved of [Vivien Leigh's][/p?id=Vivien%20Leigh] interpretation of Scarlett.</li><li>The four principals were billed on the film's posters in this order: [Clark Gable][/p?id=1178], followed by [Leslie Howard][/p?id=Leslie%20Howard] and [Olivia de Havilland][/p?id=Olivia%20de%20Havilland] and then &quot;presenting&quot; [Vivien Leigh][/p?id=Vivien%20Leigh]. This changed when [Leigh][/p?id=Vivien%20Leigh] won the Oscar.</li><li>[Clark Gable][/p?id=1178] disliked this, his most famous film, which he regarded as &quot;a woman's picture.&quot;</li></ul></section>
