Mankiewicz][/p?id=Herman%20J.%20Mankiewicz] wrote the balance of the screenplay for this film from a hospital bed recovering from illness.</li><li>The scene where Kane destroys Susan's room after she's left him was done on the first take. Director/star [Orson Welles'][/p?id=1711] hands were bleeding, and he is quoted as saying, &quot;I really felt it.&quot;</li><li>The camera looks up at Charles Foster Kane and his best friend Jedediah Leland and down at weaker characters like Susan Alexander Kane. This was a technique that [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] borrowed from [John Ford][/p?id=1483] who had used it two years previously on [Stagecoach][/f?id=12142] (1939). [Welles][/p?id=1711] privately watched [Stagecoach][/f?id=12142] (1939) about 40 times while making this film.</li><li>Despite all the publicity, the film was a box office flop and was quickly consigned to the RKO vaults. At 1941's Academy Awards the film was booed every time one of its nine nominations was announced. It was only re-released for the public in the mid-1950s.</li><li>Xanadu's design is based on William Randolph Hearst's elaborate home in San Simeon and Mont St Michel in France.</li><li>For the later scenes featuring an older Kane, [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] sat in the make-up chair from 2:30 am to be ready for a 9:00 am start.</li><li>[Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] always claimed that this picture was not the biography of one specific individual, but a composite of characters from that era in America. Though universally recognized as based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, there were also elements in the story that applied to the life of Chicago utilities magnate Samuel Insull (1859-1938).</li><li>The film showcased a technique called &quot;universal focus.&quot; To get the image of Kane and the poster picture during the speech sequence, short lenses were used. At the same time, the key light (the main lights) were gradually increased to get both images sharp and clear.</li><li>The production number of this movie given by RKO is: 281.</li><li>The original nitrate negatives are gone; they were lost in a fire during the 1970s.</li><li>In the 1970s, film critic Pauline Kael wrote an essay called &quot;Raising Kane&quot;. In it, she credited co-screenwriter [Herman J. Mankiewicz][/p?id=Herman%20J.%20Mankiewicz] for writing the entire script for this film, while alleging that [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] &quot;didn't write one line of the shooting script.&quot; However, this conclusion has very little factual basis, and was largely based on hearsay. The shooting script was actually based on two scripts (written separately by [Welles][/p?id=1711] and Mankiewicz) that [Welles][/p?id=1711] combined into one for the final version.</li><li>One line by Kane, &quot;Don't believe everything you hear on the radio,&quot; might be construed as a sly wink from [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] to those who panicked upon hearing his radio broadcast of &quot;War of the Worlds.&quot;</li><li>William Randolph Hearst was so angered by the film that he accused [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] of being a Communist in order to keep the film from being released.</li><li>The audience that watches Kane make his speech is, in fact, a still photo. To give the illusion of movement, hundreds of holes were pricked in with a pin, and lights moved about behind it.</li><li>Dispute still rages over ownership of the original idea for the script, with many claiming that it was the brainchild of co-writer [Herman J. Mankiewicz][/p?id=Herman%20J.%20Mankiewicz]. In his school days, [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] wrote a play titled &quot;Marching Song.&quot; Though never produced, it was the exploration of a public figure through the testimonies of the people in his life. Mankiewicz certainly wrote the first draft of the screenplay, which took him about six weeks.</li><li>During filming [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] received a warning that William Randolph Hearst had arranged for a naked woman to jump into his arms when he entered his hotel room, and there was also a photographer in the room to take a picture that would be used to discredit him. [Welles][/p?id=1711] spent the night elsewhere, and it is unknown if the warning was true.</li><li>Editor [Robert Wise][/p?id=Robert%20Wise] dragged the &quot;News on the March&quot; negatives over concrete, among other tortures, to give them an aged look.</li><li>[Orson Welles'][/p?id=1711] deal with RKO gave him unprecedented freedom for a first-time director. He was to write, produce, direct and act in two pictures for the company, with complete autonomy in the hiring of actors, technicians and final cut. Studio boss [George Schaefer][/p?id=George%20Schaefer] had to greenlight the project and could veto any request for extra finance over the modest $500,000 budget (which eventually would be exceeded by $200,000), but no one other than [Welles][/p?id=1711] was allowed to view the rushes.</li><li>After production wrapped, William Randolph Hearst forbade any advertisement of the film in any of his newspapers - or indeed any other RKO movies - and offered to buy the negative from studio head [George Schaefer][/p?id=George%20Schaefer] with a view to destroying it. Fortunately [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] had already previewed the film to influential industry figures to rave reviews, so it was granted a limited theatrical release. Critics from non-Hearst newspapers fell over themselves praising the film. The film itself was not reviewed in any Hearst newspaper until the mid-1970s, when the film critic for the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Examiner&quot; finally reviewed it.</li><li>When asked by friends how Kane's last words would be known when he died alone, [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] reportedly stared for a long time before saying, &quot;Don't you ever tell anyone of this.&quot; See also the Goofs entry.</li><li>For this movie [Orson Welles][/p?id=1711], along with cinematographer [Gregg Toland][/p?id=Gregg%20Toland], pioneered &quot;deep focus&quot;, a technique that keeps every object in the foreground, center and background in simultaneous focus. This brought a sense of depth to the two-dimensional world of movies.</li><li>[Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] reportedly wore out a print of [The Power and the Glory][/f?id=Hans%20Andra%20Hustru] (1933) while studying its story construction, a technique its screenwriter Preston Sturges referred to as &quot;narratige.&quot;</li><li>On the night the movie opened in San Francisco, [Welles][/p?id=1711] found himself alone with William Randolph Hearst in an elevator at the city's Fairmont Hotel. Aware that his father and Hearst were friends, [Welles][/p?id=1711] extended an invitation to the magnate to attend the premiere of [Citizen Kane][/f?id=11554] (1941). Hearst disregarded the offer and as Hearst was about to exit the elevator at his floor, [Welles][/p?id=1711] remarked, &quot;Charles Foster Kane would have accepted.&quot;</li><li>[Orson Welles][/p?id=1711] was just 25 years old when he directed this, his first feature.</li><li>The favorite film of &quot;Peanuts&quot; cartoonist Charles M. Schulz. He incorporated many references to it in his strips over the years.</li></ul></section>
