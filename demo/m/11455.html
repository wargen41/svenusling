This was never the case, however, and the false story was planted, either by a studio publicist or a press agent for the three other actors, to keep their names in the press. Meanwhile [George Raft][/p?id=George%20Raft] was angling for the part with Jack L. Warner, but Hal B. Wallis had been assigned to search for what would be [Humphrey Bogart's][/p?id=1383] next starring role. He wrote to Warner that he had found the next movie for [Bogart][/p?id=1383] and the role was perfect for him. Nobody else was ever considered for the part.</li><li>Michèle Morgan asked for $55,000, but Hal B. Wallis refused to pay it when he could get [Ingrid Bergman][/p?id=1392] for $25,000.</li><li>After shooting, Max Steiner spoke against using &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; as the song identifying Rick and Ilsa, saying he would rather compose an original song in order to qualify for royalties. However, Hal B. Wallis replied that since the filming had ended, [Ingrid Bergman][/p?id=1392] had cut her hair very short for [For Whom the Bell Tolls][/f?id=15506] (1943) which was shooting at a distant locale and she therefore could not re-shoot already-completed scenes that had used &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;.</li><li>[Paul Henreid][/p?id=Paul%20Henreid] was loaned to Warners for the role of Victor Lazlo by Selznick International Pictures against his will. He was concerned that playing a secondary character would ruin his career as a romantic lead.</li><li>Because the film was made during WWII they were not allowed to film at an airport after dark for security reasons. Instead they used a sound stage with a small cardboard cutout airplane and forced perspective. To give the illusion that the plane was full-sized, they used little people to portray the crew preparing the plane for take-off. Years later the same technique was used in the film [Alien][/f?id=10215] (1979), with director [Ridley Scott's][/p?id=1797] son and some of his friends in scaled down spacesuits.</li><li>Captain Renault's line, &quot;You like war. I like women,&quot; was changed from &quot;You enjoy war. I enjoy women,&quot; in order to meet decency standards.</li><li>[Conrad Veidt][/p?id=Conrad%20Veidt], who played Maj. Strasser, was well known in the theatrical community in Germany for his hatred of the Nazis, and in fact was forced to hurriedly escape the country when he found out that the SS had sent a death squad after him because of his anti-Nazi activities.</li><li>Many of the actors who played the Nazis were in fact German Jews who had escaped from Nazi Germany.</li><li>Rick never says &quot;Play it again, Sam.&quot; He says: &quot;You played it for her, you can play it for me. Play it!&quot;. Ilsa says &quot;Play it, Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By&quot;'.</li><li>When the Epstein brothers won an Oscar for their script, they became the first (and as for 2007 the only) Academy Award winning twins.</li><li>The film's success led to plans for a sequel, which was to be called Brazzaville. [Ingrid Bergman][/p?id=1392] was not available, so [Geraldine Fitzgerald][/p?id=Geraldine%20Fitzgerald] was considered for Ilsa before the project was killed. It was not until the late 1990s and Michael Walsh's novel &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; that a true sequel ever came to pass.</li><li>Early in the production, studio head Jack L. Warner offered the role of Rick Blaine to [George Raft][/p?id=George%20Raft], but the actor turned it down. As the shooting script took shape, producer Hal B. Wallis began to envision actor [Humphrey Bogart][/p?id=1383] in the Rick Blaine role. As [Bogart][/p?id=1383] was under contract to Warner Bros. the role was assigned to him by Wallis. But after [Bogart][/p?id=1383] had been cast in the role, [George Raft][/p?id=George%20Raft] reconsidered his decision and contacted Warner to deliver the news that he had decided to accept the '[Casablanca'][/f?id=11455] part after all. After consulting with Wallis - who had never envisioned anyone but [Bogart][/p?id=1383] in the role - Warner decided to support his producer: Warner explained to [Raft][/p?id=George%20Raft] that [Humphrey Bogart][/p?id=1383] had been cast in the role of Rick Blaine, and that the part was no longer available.</li><li>Given the extraordinary chemistry between the two leads, it's curious that [Humphrey Bogart][/p?id=1383] and [Ingrid Bergman][/p?id=1392] never appeared in another movie together, this being their one and only joint venture.</li></ul></section>
