However, [Wayne][/p?id=1504] was only able to get financial backing if he played one of the main parts, so he decided to play Crockett and cast [Widmark][/p?id=1793] as Jim Bowie.</li><li> During the battle sequence, one of the cannons rolled over the foot of [Laurence Harvey][/p?id=Laurence%20Harvey], breaking it at the instep. He continued with the scene, eventually treating the injury himself.</li><li> [John Wayne][/p?id=1504] was a fan of The Kingston Trio's recording of &quot;Remember the Alamo&quot;, composed by Jane Bowers, and wanted to use the song in the film. When, for various reasons, the rights to the song couldn't be obtained, Dimitri Tiomkin, who scored the film, and Paul Francis Webster wrote their own song for the film, &quot;The Green Leaves of Summer&quot;.</li><li> [John Wayne][/p?id=1504] partially financed this film himself. During shooting, the film was delayed due to various production problems. [Wayne][/p?id=1504] was under so much pressure, he smoked cigarettes almost non-stop when not acting.</li><li> [Sammy Davis Jr.][/p?id=Sammy%20Davis%20Jr.] managed to obtain a copy of the script and asked [John Wayne][/p?id=1504] if he could play the straight role of a Negro slave. [Wayne][/p?id=1504] considered him but eventually declined Davis' offer. Davis recalled, &quot;There were a lot of influential Texans investing in the film and they didn't like the idea that I was seeing [his future wife] May Britt at the time. They disapproved of a man of color going out with a girl who was white, though Duke [[Wayne][/p?id=1504]] was upfront with me about it and I respected him for it&quot;.</li><li> [John Wayne][/p?id=1504] intended this film to be an allegory for America's Cold War with the Soviet Union.</li><li> [Clark Gable][/p?id=1178] was offered the role of Davy Crockett but turned it down. Though [Gable][/p?id=1178] was a Republican who shared [Wayne's][/p?id=1504] anti-communist views, he did not want to commit to an expensive project with a first-time director.</li><li> Banned in Mexico.</li><li> Despite being a top-ten money maker for 1960, [John Wayne][/p?id=1504] assumed huge personal debt to get the film finished after United Artists refused to pay for cost overruns during production. It wasn't until the television rights sale in 1971 that [Wayne's][/p?id=1504] personal debts were finally paid off. It premiered on the U.S. network NBC in September 1971.</li><li> [John Wayne][/p?id=1504] and [Richard Widmark][/p?id=1793] famously did not get along during filming. Since [Widmark][/p?id=1793] was a liberal Democrat who opposed blacklisting and supported the civil-rights movement and gun control - positions diametrically opposed to [Wayne's][/p?id=1504] - it was long rumored that politics had been the cause of the problem. However, [Widmark][/p?id=1793] later cited [Wayne's][/p?id=1504] lack of directing skills as the reason for the feud. This was something [Ken Curtis][/p?id=Ken%20Curtis] agreed with, since he remarked that [Wayne][/p?id=1504] had no ability to motivate an actor for a scene.</li><li> [Sonny Tufts][/p?id=Sonny%20Tufts] was at one point considered for the role of Jim Bowie, and [Clark Gable][/p?id=1178] for the role of William Travis.</li><li> Director [John Ford][/p?id=1483] showed up on the set, and let [John Wayne][/p?id=1504] know that he wanted to direct some of the picture. [Wayne][/p?id=1504] sent him out with a small crew to do some second-unit work, mostly of Mexican cavalry riding through the countryside as they approached the Alamo, and [Frankie Avalon][/p?id=Frankie%20Avalon] estimated that the footage filmed by [Ford][/p?id=1483] made up approximately 10%-15% of the finished film. Other sources, however, have said that [Wayne][/p?id=1504] eventually deemed most of [Ford's][/p?id=1483] footage unusable, and little if any of it made it into the final cut of the film. According to these sources, the footage that [Ford][/p?id=1483] believed he shot of the Mexican cavalry patrolling the countryside was actually re-shot by a second-unit director, although [Wayne][/p?id=1504] didn't have the heart to tell [Ford][/p?id=1483].</li><li> [Charlton Heston][/p?id=1151], then a moderate Democrat, turned down the role of Jim Bowie because he feared the critical response to the movie. However, later in life [Heston][/p?id=1151] turned around and wholeheartedly embraced right-wing Republican politics, also changing his mind about not accepting the part and saying that it was &quot;a huge mistake&quot;.</li><li> [John Wayne][/p?id=1504] formed a close friendship with [Laurence Harvey][/p?id=Laurence%20Harvey] during filming. He later said [Harvey][/p?id=Laurence%20Harvey] should have received an Oscar nomination instead of [Chill Wills][/p?id=1153].</li><li> [Richard Boone][/p?id=Richard%20Boone] showed up on the first day of filming, sporting a full beard. It was then pointed out his character General Houston didn't actually have a beard.</li><li> Shot over a period of 83 days.</li><li> [Chill Wills'][/p?id=1153] aggressive campaign to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar was generally thought to bring about a backlash, most people regarding his Variety ad in which the film's cast were praying harder for [Wills][/p?id=1153] to win the Oscar than the defenders of the Alamo themselves prayed on the night before the battle as a display of poor judgment. [Wayne][/p?id=1504] himself was appalled by the tastelessness of the ad and was forced to take out an ad himself, countering it.</li><li> The set - now called Alamo Village - has since been used in over 100 other Westerns.</li><li> Both [Clark Gable][/p?id=1178] and [Charlton Heston][/p?id=1151], the two actors [John Wayne][/p?id=1504] wanted most to do the film, both expressed regret at not taking the parts they were offered. [Heston][/p?id=1151] declined the role of 'Bowie' out of political ideology (a political view he later later vehemently rejected), and [Gable][/p?id=1178] passed due to to the age difference between himself and William Travis. [Gable's][/p?id=1178] family later said that he wanted to do the film as a way to do &quot;a macho film&quot; to escape the typecasting of [Gone with the Wind][/f?id=11270] (1939) as a romantic lead.</li></ul></section>
