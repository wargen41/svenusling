Romero's][/p?id=George%20A.%20Romero] &quot;Dead&quot; trilogy. Nonetheless, it's gained a cult following over the last three decades.</li><li>During a holiday break in filming, makeup artist [Greg Nicotero][/p?id=Greg%20Nicotero] used the realistic and gruesome model of his own head (as seen in a laboratory scene in the film) to play a practical joke on his mother.</li><li>The original script, for which [George A. Romero][/p?id=George%20A.%20Romero] couldn't get budget, involved the scientists living above ground in a fortress protected by electrified fences and the military living safely underground. It also involved a small army of trained zombies and the conclusion to the trilogy more brutal than the released version. This later became the basis of [Land of the Dead][/f?id=Land%20of%20the%20Dead] (2005)</li><li>On the special edition DVD, director [George A. Romero][/p?id=George%20A.%20Romero] claims this is his favourite film out of the original &quot;dead trilogy&quot;.</li><li>Most of the zombie extras in this film were Pittsburgh residents who volunteered to help in the film.</li><li>Although never confirmed, it has been rumored by fans that the character Joe [Pilato][/p?id=Joseph%20Pilato] played in [Dawn of the Dead (1978)][/f?id=Dawn%20of%20the%20Dead%20(1978)] is in fact Rhodes as a cop. Fans believe that Rhodes started out as a cop then later joined the army and became Captain. Since no passage of time is given in the 'Dead' films it is very possible that years lapsed between 'Dawn' and 'Day', and that the Rhodes character could have went from being a cop to an army captain.</li><li>First attempts to shoot the scene where Sarah performs surgery on Miguel's arm failed when it simply bounced off the rubber, so [Tom Savini][/p?id=Tom%20Savini] remade it in wax and it worked perfectly.</li><li>According to Lori Cardille, the first attempt to shoot the beginning dream scene where the zombie arms suddenly spring out of the wall and attack her resulted in the faux wall and many of the actors behind it toppling over on her. The wall ended up needing to be completely rebuilt, this time much more stable.</li><li>The budget for [George A. Romero's][/p?id=George%20A.%20Romero] original script was estimated at $7 million, but he would only be given the money if he could film an R-rated film. He was told that if he went ahead and shot an unrated film with no limits on gore, the budget would be split in half to $3.5 million.</li><li>[George A. Romero][/p?id=George%20A.%20Romero] originally intended the film to be &quot;the [Gone with the Wind][/f?id=11270] (1939) of zombie films&quot;.</li><li>In an interview [Joseph Pilato][/p?id=Joseph%20Pilato] was asked if [George A. Romero][/p?id=George%20A.%20Romero] &quot;had him in mind&quot;, [Pilato][/p?id=Joseph%20Pilato] stated that one of the reasons why he got the role was because of the budget being scaled down from 7 to 3.5 million.</li><li>If one looks closely as Rhodes is torn in half, they'll see that a large section of his innards is a blood-covered rubber chicken.</li><li>There was a large problem with the scenes with guns firing, as the blanks used would almost never be caught on film, due to the camera's shutter. This made director [George A. Romero][/p?id=George%20A.%20Romero] animate almost all of the gun's muzzle flashes in post-production. Actress Lori Cardille also described using the Uzi during filming as having such a large recoil kick that it physically forced her back.</li><li>[Joseph Pilato][/p?id=Joseph%20Pilato] was cast as Rhodes, the film's antagonist. As stated by [Pilato][/p?id=Joseph%20Pilato] &quot;He pretty much just gave it to me. I don't know if he auditioned other people, but it was very quick. I came in and it was like, &quot;You got it!.&quot;</li></ul></section>
