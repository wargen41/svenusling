It turned out to be such a success that [Zemeckis][/p?id=Robert%20Zemeckis] was able to go forward on his own project, [Back to the Future][/f?id=20376] (1985).</li><li>This was the only produced screenplay for writer Diane Thomas. She had been working as a waitress in Malibu when producer/star [Michael Douglas][/p?id=1646] optioned her script for $250,000, allowing her to quit her job. Sadly, Thomas died in a car accident, while working on a new movie project with [Steven Spielberg][/p?id=1907] the following year, about seven weeks before the opening of this film's sequel, [The Jewel of the Nile][/f?id=12015] (1985). She was a passenger while her boyfriend was driving - in a Porsche that [Douglas][/p?id=1646] had bought for her as a thank you gift. [The Jewel of the Nile][/f?id=12015] (1985) was dedicated &quot;In Memory of&quot; Thomas.</li><li>Reports of kidnappings in Colombia forced the location shoots to be done in Mexico.</li><li>The Eddy Grant song &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; did not feature prominently in the film (the guitar solo can be heard in the background of the scene where Joan and Jack enter the house of her &quot;fan,&quot; Juan) and was not included on the soundtrack album. Although he was commisioned to write the song for the movie, the filmmakers chose not to use it. When the movie was released and proved to be a big hit, Eddy released the song on his own. One of the video clips of the song, however, makes prominent use of footage from various scenes from the film.</li><li>According to [Kathleen Turner's][/p?id=Kathleen%20Turner] memoir, [Michael Douglas][/p?id=1646] originally offered the role of Joan to [Debra Winger][/p?id=Debra%20Winger]. They met at a Mexican restaurant to discuss it but, according to [Douglas][/p?id=1646], she ended up biting him. She didn't get the part.</li><li>Actress [Kathleen Turner][/p?id=Kathleen%20Turner] once said of working with director [Robert Zemeckis][/p?id=Robert%20Zemeckis]: &quot;I remember terrible arguments [with [Zemeckis][/p?id=Robert%20Zemeckis]] doing Romancing. He's a film-school grad, fascinated by cameras and effects. I never felt that he knew what I was having to do to adjust my acting to some of his damn cameras - sometimes he puts you in ridiculous postures. I'd say, 'This is not helping me! This is not the way I like to work, thank you!'&quot;.</li><li>[Alan Silvestri][/p?id=Alan%20Silvestri] was hired to do a temporary score for the film, but director [Robert Zemeckis][/p?id=Robert%20Zemeckis] liked his work so much that he kept him on as composer.</li><li>In the famous dance scene, [Michael Douglas][/p?id=1646] was not aware that he was being filmed. He was dancing with [Kathleen Turner][/p?id=Kathleen%20Turner] and some extras, and was surprised to find [Robert Zemeckis][/p?id=Robert%20Zemeckis] had been filming him the entire time.</li><li>[Michael Douglas][/p?id=1646] was intrigued by the script despite some initial hesitation, but was ultimately won over by the opportunity to exhibit the rock climbing skills he'd honed as a teenager. A 16-year old Michael would join his dad in rock climbing during breaks in filming 1960's [Spartacus][/f?id=18652], which was shot largely in Death Valley, Nevada.</li><li>According to the RTS DVD extra [Rekindling the Romance: A Look Back at 'Romancing the Stone'][/f?id=Rekindling%20the%20Romance%3A%20A%20Look%20Back%20at%20'Romancing%20the%20Stone'] (2006) mini documentary, [Michael Douglas][/p?id=1646] and [Danny DeVito][/p?id=1207] were roommates during their time in NYC when 'starting out' in show business. Additionally, [DeVito][/p?id=1207] notes that [Douglas][/p?id=1646] got his break first with the TV series [Streets Of ][/f?id=Streets%20Of%20]San Francisco[The Streets of ][/f?id=]San Francisco:::: (1972) but continued to pay his share of the rent even after leaving their apartment in NYC for Hollywood. He would later, as producer and reluctant lead character, Jack T. Colton, offer the part of 'Ralph' to [DeVito][/p?id=1207] which [DeVito][/p?id=1207] admits was helpful exposure-wise to his career.</li><li>[Clint Eastwood][/p?id=1184], [Jack Nicholson][/p?id=1402], [Christopher Reeve][/p?id=1172] turned down the role of Jack T. Colton, before [Michael Douglas][/p?id=1646] accepted the part.</li><li>The scene in which Joan Wilder offers to pay Jack T. Colton in traveler's checks and he asks if they are American Express is a reference to the American Express commercials featuring [Karl Malden][/p?id=1526], who previously co-starred with [Michael Douglas][/p?id=1646] in [Streets Of ][/f?id=Streets%20Of%20]San Francisco[The Streets of ][/f?id=]San Francisco:::: (1972).</li><li>This was [Michael Douglas'][/p?id=1646] first action film.</li><li>After the film's original cut scored very low with preview audiences, Fox Studios feared it would be a flop and [Zemeckis][/p?id=Robert%20Zemeckis] was fired from his next film, Cocoon. He knew Stone could be saved and made substantial changes. The film was shortened, with material following the discovery of the crashed plane largely eliminated. New scenes were written and shot, mostly involving the prologue and epilogue, focusing on Joan needing to find a good man. The original scenes of Joan with a male publisher were replaced by the moments with Gloria as her editor, taking her to a bar, encouraging her to date and bolstering her romantic dreams and desires. Another big revision was the re-filming the scene in the crashed plane's fuselage where Joan and Jack learn about each other. Changes in Joan and Jack's appearances can be seen between the exterior shots of the plane to the studio-shot interior, which was filmed five months later, including a post-shoot weight gain by [Douglas][/p?id=1646].</li><li>[Paul Newman][/p?id=1727] was offered the part of Jack Colton but he felt that there was unnecessary and excessive violence in the movie.</li><li>[Jessica Lange][/p?id=Jessica%20Lange] turned down the part of Joan Wilder in order to tackle &quot;more serious&quot; work.</li><li>[Sylvester Stallone][/p?id=1915] turned down the role of Jack P. Colton in order to star in Rhinestone (1984), a decision he deeply regretted.</li></ul></section>
