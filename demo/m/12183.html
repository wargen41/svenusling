But [De Niro][/p?id=1808] turned down the part, saying that it was too similar to many of the parts he had played in the past. In the end, the part went to [Danny Aiello][/p?id=1206]. [Robert De Niro's][/p?id=1808] photo is one of the pictures that appear on Sal's &quot;Wall of Fame.&quot;</li><li>According to [Rosie Perez][/p?id=Rosie%20Perez], her face is not shown in her nude scene, because she felt exploited and was crying. She later decided she didn't mind, and appeared nude again in other movies.</li><li>All of the scenes of the cornermen ([Robin Harris][/p?id=Robin%20Harris], [Paul Benjamin][/p?id=Paul%20Benjamin], and [Frankie Faison][/p?id=Frankie%20Faison]) were improvised.</li><li>[Spike Lee][/p?id=1889] wrote the script in two weeks.</li><li>The key scene when [Danny Aiello][/p?id=1206] and [John Turturro][/p?id=1502] talk alone, approximately midway through the film, was partly improvised. The scripted scene ended as the character Smiley approached the window. Everything after that, until the end of the scene, was completely ad-libbed.</li><li>Feature film debut of [Martin Lawrence][/p?id=Martin%20Lawrence] (Cee).</li><li>This film was inspired by an actual incident in New York City, where some black youths were chased out of a pizzeria by some white youths in a section of New York City known as Howard Beach.</li><li>Radio Raheem's explanation of the love and hate rings he wears, is an homage to the speech that The Preacher gave in [The Night of the Hunter][/f?id=20733] (1955). [Robert Mitchum's][/p?id=1815] preacher has tattoos on his hands that say &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;Hate&quot;.</li><li>In the original scripted ending, Sal and Mookie reconcile. Sal, although upset, tells Mookie that he understands that Mookie had to do the right thing. [Spike Lee][/p?id=1889] claimed that original producer Paramount even demanded at the last moment that Sal and Mookie should hug. [Lee][/p?id=1889] refused, calling it a &quot;Hollywood bullsh#t ending&quot;, as he wanted the epilogue to remain truthful to the characters, and took the project to Universal Pictures.</li><li>[Laurence Fishburne][/p?id=1567] was offered, but turned down the role of Radio Raheem.</li><li>[Wesley Snipes][/p?id=1998] turned down a role in the film, in order to star in [Major League][/f?id=21796] (1989). He teamed up with Writer and Director [Spike Lee][/p?id=1889] for [Mo' Better Blues][/f?id=Mo'%20Better%20Blues] (1990), and was the lead in [Jungle Fever][/f?id=Jungle%20Fever] (1991).</li><li>[Danny Aiello][/p?id=1206] admitted that he almost turned down the part of Sal when he saw that he'd be playing the owner of a pizzeria, believing it to be a lazy stereotype of Italian-Americans despite the high number of pizzerias that are owned by Italian-Americans.</li><li>[Spike Lee][/p?id=1889] spent his free time on the set writing the screenplay for [Mo' Better Blues][/f?id=Mo'%20Better%20Blues] (1990).</li><li>[Spike Lee][/p?id=1889] turned down [Tougher Than Leather][/f?id=Tougher%20Than%20Leather] (1988) to direct this film.</li><li>The building Sal's Pizzeria was in did not exist before shooting. Rather, it was constructed on an empty lot by the production company, and subsequently torn down after shooting wrapped.</li><li>On both an interview, and the audio commentary for the Criterion DVD of the film, [Spike Lee][/p?id=1889] says that the project was originally at Paramount Pictures, but the studio was worried about the climax, and wanted it toned down. [Lee][/p?id=1889] refused, and in the same weekend Paramount Pictures turned the project down, Universal Pictures picked it up for distribution.</li><li>[Ossie Davis][/p?id=1712] (Da Mayor) and [Ruby Dee][/p?id=Ruby%20Dee] (Mother Sister) were wife and husband in real life and frequently performed together until [Davis'][/p?id=1712] death in 2005.</li><li>Features [Danny Aiello's][/p?id=1206] only Oscar-nominated performance.</li><li>[James Earl Jones][/p?id=1417] was originally offered the role of &quot;Da Mayor&quot;, but turned it down in order to make [Best of the Best][/f?id=15394] (1989).</li><li>[Spike Lee's][/p?id=1889] first choice for the role of Pino was [Matt Dillon][/p?id=Matt%20Dillon].</li><li>In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #96 Greatest Movie of All Time. It was the first inclusion of this film on the list.</li><li>The opening dance sequence with [Rosie Perez][/p?id=Rosie%20Perez], was inspired by the opening credit sequence with Ann-Margret, in [Bye Bye Birdie][/f?id=Bye%20Bye%20Birdie] (1963).</li><li>The opening sequence, which featured the song &quot;Fight The Power&quot;, was written especially for the movie. [Rosie Perez][/p?id=Rosie%20Perez] dancing to the song took eight hours to film.</li><li>The entire shoot took place on one commandeered block in Brooklyn. Extra care was taken, to ensure the experience was palatable to the residents of that block, and the production even hired a couple of residents on that block.</li><li>The film is included on Roger Ebert's &quot;Great Movies&quot; list.</li><li>[Spike Lee][/p?id=1889] reprised his role as Mookie in [Red Hook Summer][/f?id=Red%20Hook%20Summer] (2012), also written and directed by [Lee][/p?id=1889].</li><li>During the 1990 Oscar ceremony, while announcing the Best Picture nominees, [Kim Basinger][/p?id=Kim%20Basinger] caused some controversy when she ignored her scripted text and said: &quot;We've got five great films here, and they're great for one reason: because they tell the truth. But there is one film missing from this list, that deserves to be on it, because ironically, it might tell the biggest truth of all, and that's [Do the Right Thing][/f?id=12183] (1989).&quot; [Spike Lee][/p?id=1889] would later thank her for it in a 2019 episode of the podcast &quot;Unspooled&quot;.</li><li>[Spike Lee][/p?id=1889] criticized several (white) critics for their perceived racist reviews, in which they stated that the movie would incite anger and cause riots in the black population, and if this were to happen, the blood would be on [Lee's][/p?id=1889] hands. [Lee][/p?id=1889] defended his movie by stating that if white people can contain themselves from causing trouble after seeing movie violence in [Arnold Schwarzenegger][/p?id=1062] films, then so can black people. He would later praise Roger Ebert as one of the few white critics who understood the film's message of mutual understanding.</li><li>According to [Spike Lee][/p?id=1889], the casting of [Rosie Perez][/p?id=Rosie%20Perez] came about during a birthday party he was hosting in a club in LA. When the R&amp;B song &quot;Da Butt&quot; by Experience Unlimited from his previous movie [School Daze][/f?id=School%20Daze] (1988) started playing, a spontaneous &quot;butt contest&quot; was held. [Lee][/p?id=1889] saw [Perez][/p?id=Rosie%20Perez] dancing on top of a speaker, and told her to come down, fearing that she would fall off and hurt herself, and he would get sued. Security had to step in to force [Perez][/p?id=Rosie%20Perez] down, after which she profusely cursed at [Lee][/p?id=1889]. [Lee][/p?id=1889] was in awe of her voice, and quickly learned that they were both from the same part of Brooklyn. He offered her the part of Mookie's girlfriend on the spot, deciding that she would be Puertorican.</li><li>[Spike Lee][/p?id=1889] credits then-president of Universal Pictures Thomas Philip Pollock for standing by the movie, even after it caused considerable controversy during its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. The movie was planned for a summer 1989 USA release, but Pollock was under heavy pressure to release it in the fall out of fear of inciting riots. This was all the more pressing since Pollock was still under bodyguard protection after releasing [The Last Temptation of Christ][/f?id=15556] (1988), as he and his family had been getting death threats. Even [Lee][/p?id=1889] told Pollock that he would understand if the movie were released at a later time, but Pollock stood by his decision and released the film on the intended date.</li></ul></section>
